# 🤖 Mr. Pinchy Robot – ROS 2 Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic Simulation

**Mr. Pinchy** is a custom differential-drive robot with an articulated arm, designed and built completely from scratch using URDF/Xacro, Gazebo plugins, and ROS 2 Jazzy.  
This project demonstrates how to simulate a full robot in **Gazebo Harmonic**, visualize it in **RViz 2**, and control it with keyboard commands.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

Mr. Pinchy is a differential-drive robot with:
- Two wheels and a caster for movement  
- A two-joint arm with revolute joints  
- Custom meshes created manually  
- Full Gazebo and RViz integration  
- Keyboard-based teleoperation and arm control

This project serves as a **great reference for anyone starting with Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2 Jazzy**, especially if you want to:
- Understand **diff-drive robots** with control plugins  
- Learn how to **add meshes** to URDFs  
- Practice **controlling revolute joints** in Gazebo

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**
- **ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco**
- **Gazebo Harmonic**
- Python 3.12+
- colcon and rosdep for building

---

## 🚀 How to Run from Scratch

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mr_pinchy_robot.git
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

### 3. Build the Workspace

```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 4. Launch in Gazebo

Run the Gazebo simulation with all plugins loaded:

```bash
ros2 launch mr_pinchy_robot_bringup mr_pinchy_gazebo.launch.xml
```

This will:

* Spawn the robot in an empty world
* Load control and bridge configurations
* Start the differential drive plugin and arm joint control

### 5. Visualize in RViz 2

In a separate terminal:

```bash
ros2 launch mr_pinchy_robot_description display.launch.xml
```

---

## 🎮 Controls

While the simulation is running, focus your terminal window and use:

| Key               | Action                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **W / S / A / D** | Move the robot (forward/backward/turn) |
| **Q / Z**         | Move lower arm joint up/down           |
| **E / C**         | Move upper arm joint up/down           |

---

## 📦 Nodes & Launch Files

| Package                         | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **mr_pinchy_robot_description** | URDF/Xacro definitions, meshes, and RViz config   |
| **mr_pinchy_robot_bringup**     | Launch files for Gazebo and robot state publisher |
| **pinchy_robot_controller**     | Python node to control robot and arm joints       |

---

## 🧠 Key Files

* `mr_pinchy_gazebo.launch.xml` — launches robot in Gazebo
* `display.launch.xml` — displays robot in RViz
* `controllers.yaml` — defines joint and diff-drive controllers
* `mr_pinchy_controller.py` — main keyboard control node

---

## 💡 Why This Project is Useful
